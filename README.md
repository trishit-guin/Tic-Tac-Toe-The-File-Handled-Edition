# Tic-Tac-Toe-The-File-Handled-Edition
<p> This software comprises of two parts, one is the game
tic tac toe and the other is the implementation of data
handling to record each step of the individual players in
a text file. </p>
<p> The development of this software is done using basic
and simple python code and database in the form of text
files. This work is a base structure of a bigger program
which can be built using the implementation of AI for
more complex board games and can be used in
professional playing tournaments. </p>
